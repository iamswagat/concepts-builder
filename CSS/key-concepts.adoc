*Cascading Style Sheets* are used to style and layout web pages - e.g., alter font, color, size and spacing of the content.

== 1. Introduction to CSS
=== 1.1 How CSS works
==== 1.1.1 What is CSS?
CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users

==== 1.1.2 How does CSS affect HTML?
Browsers apply *CSS Rules* to document to affect how they are displayed.

A CSS Rule is formed from::
1. *Properties* -> which have values set to update how the HTML content is displayed e.g., `background-color`, `width`, `text`, `font` etc
2. *Selector* ->which selects the element(s) you want to apply the updated property values to e.g.,`p`, `body`, `div` etc

[NOTE]
``h1{ color: blue; }`` -- each property/value pair is called a *declaration*

==== 1.1.3 How does CSS actually work?
Its is 2 stage process::
1. The browser converts HTML and CSS into the DOM. It combines the document's content with its style.
2. The browser displays the contents of the DOM.

==== 1.1.4 About the DOM
The DOM represents the document in the computer's memory. +
1. The browser will parse the HTML and create a DOM from it +
2. The browser will then parse the CSS and apply CSS rule to applicable elements via the selectors and properties.

==== 1.1.5 How to apply your CSS to your HTML
There are 3 ways for applying CSS in HTML document::
1. External Stylesheet::
CSS written in a separate file with a .css extension, and you reference it from an HTML `<link>` element
2. Internal Stylesheet::
CSS placed inside a `<style>` element, contained inside the HTML head
3. Inline Styles::
CSS declarations that affect one element only, contained within a style attribute.
[CAUTION]
Please don't do this, unless you really have to! It is really bad for maintenance

=== 1.2 CSS syntax
==== 1.2.1 CSS Declarations

[IMPORTANT]
If a *property* is _unknown_ or if a *value* is not valid for a given property, the declaration is deemed invalid and is wholly ignored by the browser's CSS engine.

==== 1.2.2 CSS Declaration Blocks

[NOTE]
Blocks can sometimes be nested; in such cases opening and closing braces must be nested logically, in the same fashion as the tags of nested HTML elements. The most common example you'll come across are @-rules, which are blocks beginning with an @ identifier like `@media`, `@font-face`, etc

==== 1.2.3 CSS Selectors and Rules

==== 1.2.4 CSS Statements
Along with CSS Rules other CSS statements are::
*At-rules* is a CSS statement that instructs CSS how to behave.
[source, CSS]
----
/* General structure */
@IDENTIFIER (RULE);
----
*Nested statements* are a specific subset of at-rule, the syntax of which is a nested block of CSS rules that will only be applied to the document if a specific condition is matched.
[source, css]
----
@media (min-width: 801px) {
  body {
    margin: 0 auto;
    width: 800px;
  }
}
----
=== 1.3 Selectors
Different types of selectors::
1. *Simple selectors* => Match one or more elements based on element type, `class`, or `id`.
2. *Attribute selectors* => Match one or more elements based on their attributes/attribute values.
3. *Pseudo-classes* => Match one or more elements that exist in a certain state
4. *Pseudo-elements* => Match one or more parts of content that are in a certain position in relation to an element
5. *Combinators* => combining two or more selectors in useful ways for very specific selections
6. *Multiple selectors* =>  multiple selectors on the same CSS rule, separated by commas, to apply a single set of declarations to all the elements selected by those selectors.

=== 1.4 Simple selectors
==== 1.4.1 Element Selector or Type Selector
This selector is just a case-insensitive match between the selector name and a given HTML element name.

==== 1.4.2 Class Selector
The class selector consists of a dot, '.', followed by a class name. A class name is any value, without spaces, placed within an HTML `class` attribute.

==== 1.4.3 ID selector
The ID selector consists of a hash/pound symbol (#), followed by the ID name of a given element. Any element can have a unique ID name set with the `id` attribute.

==== 1.4.4 Universal selector
It allows selecting all elements in a page, often used in combination with other selectors

=== 1.5 Attribute selectors
Attribute selectors are a special kind of selector that will match elements based on their attributes and attribute values.
`[attr]` : This selector will select all elements with the attribute attr, whatever its value.
`[attr=val]` : This selector will select all elements with the attribute attr, but only if its value is val.
`[attr~=val]`: This selector will select all elements with the attribute attr, but only if  val is one of a space-separated list of words contained in attr's value.
