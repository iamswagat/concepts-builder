== 6. HTTP Caching
*Browser cache*, when browser stores some of the static content within the local storage. +
*Proxy cache* (CDNs), when a pseudo-web server cache static content in order to ease load on the main server and serves directly to the client bypassing the main server.

[NOTE]
Any Server URI that can be reached with an HTTP *GET* is a candidate for caching as they are [.underline]#idempotent# and [.underline]#read-only#

[NOTE]
Dynamic Data that are concurrently accessed can also be a candidate for caching.

HTTP defines a set of build-in cache semantics which gives a fine-grained control over caching behavior of both browser and proxy caches.

=== 6.1 Expires Headers
A HTTP Header Response #`Expires`# tells the browser that it can be cached and for how long. +
The value is a `Date` in the future when the data is no longer valid, incase the date is reached then the data should not be used and be retrieved again from server.

=== 6.2 Cache-Control

=== 6.3 Revalidation and Conditional GETs
